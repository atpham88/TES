# Model Overview

The TES model is an optimization-based model that minimizes the total energy cost to meet buildings space/water heating load using a system of thermal energy storage coupled with heat pump.

The TES model can be run for a single building of choice or all 400 representative buildings in any of the 55 major US cities. Only Detroit is available right now. Other cities will be added shortly.

# Running Model
Run model from dashboard.py.

# Model Outputs
Hourly operations of TES (charging, discharging,  SOC) and heat pump (output to TES, output to serve load).

Hourly purchase of electricity from utilities

Total system cost.
