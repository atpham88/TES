# About
Thermal Energy Storage Model for space heating coupled with heat pumps in residential buildings

# Model Overview
The TES model is an optimization-based model that minimizes the total heating electricity cost to meet buildings space heating load using a system of thermal energy storage coupled with heat pump.

The TES model can be run for a single building of choice or all 400 representative buildings in any of the 16 major US cities included in the study. Only Detroit is available right now. Other cities will be added shortly.

# Running Model
Run model from dashboard.py.

# Model Outputs
Hourly operations of TES (charging, discharging, SOC) and heat pump (output to TES, output to serve load).

Hourly purchase of electricity from utilities

Total system cost.
